# time-tracker-POC 
The goal of this project was to create a web application for a development company to track time spent on projects.

## How to get started :
* Make sure you have JAVA_HOME and MAVEN_HOME as system variables (check this tutorial if not : https://mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/)  
* Pull the project   
* Go into the project and use npm install   
* Then, use the command ./mvnw the first time you build the project   
* The other times, use ./mvnw -P-webpack, it makes it faster and should auto reload the project   
  
* Alternative : npm start in powershell, and launch on eclipse your project.
